You never know what i gonna do, do you ? 
I'm free, FREE
When I need them, where are they ? 
It's not something outsiders can accompany, my love
Don't you try to distract me
My glorious moment
I love it when you follow me till the end of the world;But out there;It's not your world anymore
Reasons that none can understand;But they...They can
But I'll no longer be stranded in this;Cruel;World
But there comes eternal scars;Waiting to bleed
I hate breaking promises;But;It'll be my only time disappointing you...
In the end of the world;There is no way
