Touch the stars to rewrite the stars
Sometimes;To save someone;Word is never enough...
The moon cycles;When it stops;The world stops
If you are struggling;Ask the sky
Light up the rain
Everything you have done;Is on the surface
The sky takes as it gives
Your efforts always stay within
Go back and fourth in case you don't remember
Press arrow button to move 
Please do not touch the console :(; It's still in development 
OwO If you enjoy my game; I will love ya for sum donation <3
